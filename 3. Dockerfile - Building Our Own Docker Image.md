Next, we are going to build our own Docker image from a JavaScript application.

Consider the following scenario: you have developed an application feature, you have tested it, 
and now you're ready to deploy it. 

To deploy it, the application needs to be packaged into it's own docker container. 

This means we will need to build a docker image from our JavaScript Node JS application and  and 
prepare it to be deployed on some environment to review

Review from 1:42:21 till 1:43:44

In order to build a docker image from an application, we have to copy the contents of the application into the 
Docker File. It could be an artifact that we built.

We also need to configure it and we can do this by using a blueprint for building images, which is called
a docker file.

# What is a docker file and what does it looks like

Dcoker File is a blueprint to creating docker images. 

## Syntax of Docker File

The first line of a docker file is: `FROM {name_of_image}`

![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/107522496/203792940-5e2c2976-41a6-4914-aca8-b31ae735d168.png)


Whatever image you are building, you always want to base it on another image. In our case, we have a JavaScript application with Node JS backend, so we are going to need a node inside of our container so that it can run our node application instead of basing it on a Linux Alpine or some other lower level image, because then we would have to install node ourselves on it.

---

![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/107522496/203793659-66ae60f7-b896-4440-a569-2a40e1bc9f3e.png)

So we will be taking a ready node image. And in order to see that, let's actually go to Docker Hub.

Here, we have a ready Node image that we can base our own image from.

---

![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/107522496/203794055-3a262ee7-4c99-4f17-9862-a3fdf55bb6ee.png)

So, this means that we will have Node installed inside of our image. 

So, when we start a container and we actually get a terminal of the container, we can see that node command is available because there is node installed there. This is what `FROM node` gives us.

---


Next, we can configure enviromental variables inside of our docker file

`ENV` this command allows us to set the environmental variables inside of the image environment.

---

![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/107522496/203794910-60bab933-76df-4376-8c66-51d0a46055ae.png)

Next command is `RUN`.

All these Capital Letter Commands we see are a part of a Syntex of a docker file...

![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/107522496/203795558-aedc25dc-95d6-4b47-82cd-fbb9e44bc0e7.png)

using `RUN`, csn run any kind of Linux command.  

---

![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/107522496/203795681-05fc126f-2af0-4f8a-b571-8a14a0f7bf19.png)

Important to note: this directory is going to live inside of the container. So when we start a container from this image, this /home/App directory will be created inside of the container, and not on my laptop/host.

> All the commands we use in the docker file, will apply to the container enviromentand will not affect host/laptop enviroment. 

`RUN` is used to run Linux commands. This is one fo the most used commands. 

---

![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/107522496/203811948-d161340e-17bf-49e1-93f8-7f2d0e2fcaf2.png)

Wel aso have a `COPY` command. 

The copy command that you see here, it actually executes on the host. And you see the first parameter is `.` and the second parameter is `/home/app`. So source and the target.

So I can copy files that I have on my host inside of that container image.

Because if I were to execute `run cp <source> <destination>`, this command would execute inside of the Docker container, but I have the files I want to copy, on my host.

The last one is `CMD`. This is always part of the Docker File. It executes an entry point Linux command

So this line what the command translates to is node server.js.

---

What is the difference between RUN and CMD? We could have said `RUN node server.js`

![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/107522496/203814228-569e3683-9982-4e9e-9ab1-180b8a2a9e74.png)

The difference is that CMD is an entry point

So you can have multiple run commands with Linux commands, but only one CMD. The CMD command marks the Docker File that this is the command we want to execute as an entry point. IN this case, the CMD command will run the server.

---

# Creating the Dockerfile

![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/107522496/203815126-c1c07237-5496-4be9-a082-528769212376.png)

Just like the Docker Compose file, Docker file is part of the application code. Create a new file.

---

![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/107522496/203815496-c3dfb866-3df8-48eb-aae1-00b324fd5e89.png)

Instead of having the latest node verison, we will specify the node version, in this case 13-alpine.

---

Docker file is a blueprint for any Docker image, that should actually mean that every Docker image that there is on Docker Hub should be built on its own Docker file.

![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/107522496/203815923-a1c809e7-ded7-4a60-8d7e-79efc044ca8a.png)

![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/107522496/203815999-86264d90-fe77-437f-a477-56b3e53efdff.png)

To see the Docker File, click on the tag of the version you want to install. Each image should have its own Docker File. 

> Every image is basedd off another base image...

![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/107522496/203817006-d9b900e5-4658-4555-b464-9de37cd16e00.png)

Here, 13-alpine is based off alpine 3.10

---

To visually comprehend how these layers stacking works with images, let's consider this simplified visualization.

![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/107522496/203817800-48e4ea4e-ca5b-42ef-9976-bd66185f6cd7.png)

So our own image that we're building app version 1.0, is going to be based on a node image with a specific version. That's why we're going to specify `FROM Node:13-alpine`.

And the `node:13-alpine` image, as we saw in the Docker file, is based on alpine:3.10 image.

---

Let's go back and complete our Docker File.

# Naming Docker Files

![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/107522496/203818189-0a5c6768-0e90-4a51-8f5a-365692fd54fe.png)

Have to name the Dcoker File as `Dockerfile`

![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/107522496/203818286-81ce955f-11c3-4131-91a5-04c19eb77c3a.png)

Now we have a Docker File ready, let's see how to use it.

In order to build a an image using Docker file, we have to provide two parameters.

![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/107522496/203819257-826d42a2-1db2-4627-a5a8-e547fbfef5f3.png)

1. Name and a tag - just like all the other images have. We'll do this using `-t`. We will call our image `my-app` and give it a tag of `1.0`. Tag can be anythin, so can call it `my-app:version1`
2. The location of the Docker File - in this case, because the docker file is in the same directory, we can use a `.`

![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/107522496/203821052-3fdcacea-dff5-4b26-af4a-128892e64a8c.png)

We can see that the image has been successfully built and this is its ID. 

---

![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/107522496/203821266-f167b857-64ab-4e17-8718-c35b5ea13fc8.png)

Because this device already has node:13-alpine on it, it uses that to pull the image. If you have not got it already, it will saying `pulling`

---

Using the `docker images` command, we can see our image has been built. 

---

Jenkins, takes the Docker File with the code that we created and committed to the repository, and builds a Docker Image based on the Docker File and pushes it to the Docker Repository.

![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/107522496/203822341-59dab190-bfe3-4d9c-8ce2-c4514c98367d.png)

And from the Docker Repository, either people can take it, for example, a tester, maybe want to download the image from there and test it locally, or a development server can actually pull it from there.
