Next, we are going to build our own Docker image from a JavaScript application.

Consider the following scenario: you have developed an application feature, you have tested it, 
and now you're ready to deploy it. 

To deploy it, the application needs to be packaged into it's own docker container. 

This means we will need to build a docker image from our JavaScript Node JS application and  and 
prepare it to be deployed on some environment to review

In order to build a docker image from an application, we have to copy the contents of the application into the 
Docker File. It could be an artifact that we built.

We also need to configure it and we can do this by using a blueprint for building images, which is called
a docker file.
