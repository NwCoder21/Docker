Next, we are going to build our own Docker image from a JavaScript application.

Consider the following scenario: you have developed an application feature, you have tested it, 
and now you're ready to deploy it. 

To deploy it, the application needs to be packaged into it's own docker container. 

This means we will need to build a docker image from our JavaScript Node JS application and  and 
prepare it to be deployed on some environment to review

In order to build a docker image from an application, we have to copy the contents of the application into the 
Docker File. It could be an artifact that we built.

We also need to configure it and we can do this by using a blueprint for building images, which is called
a docker file.

# What is a docker file and what does it looks like

Dcoker File is a blueprint to creating docker images. 

## Syntax of Docker File

The first line of a docker file is: `FROM {name_of_image}`

Whatever image you are building, you always want to base it on another image. In our case, we have a JavaScript application with Node JS backend, so we are going to need a node inside of our container so that it can run our node application instead of basing it on a Linux Alpine or some other lower level image, because then we would have to install node ourselves on it.

So we will be taking a ready node image. And in order to see that, let's actually go to Docker Hub.

Here, we have a ready Node image that we can base our own image from.

So, this means that we will have Node installed inside of our image. 

So, when we start a container and we actually get a terminal of the container, we can see that node command is available because there is node installed there. This is what `FROM node` gives us.

Next, we can configure enviromental variables inside of our docker file
