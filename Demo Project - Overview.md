# Demo Project - Overview

To see how Docker integrates the various steps of software development and deployment, continuous delivery and continuous integration    

In the software development workflow, we have the classical steps of development and continuous delivery and continuous integration, 
and then eventually, the software gets deployed on some type of environment, such as a test environment or a development environment. 

Here, we'll be looking at an overview of the workflow and look at then specific parts of the workflow and how Docker plays a role in all these steps.

A simple scenario is where we are trying to develop a JavaScript  application which uses a Mongo Database. Instead of installing the Mongo Database,
we download a docker container from the docker hub. We then connect the JavaScript application to the Mongo DB and start development.

Once the first version is done locally, let's say we want to test it or deploy it in a development environment where someone else from the team 
is going to run and test it. 

To do this, let's say we then commit the application to Git or another version control system. This will trigger a continuous integration 
using a Jenkins build or whatever we have decided to configure. Jenkins' build will produce artifacts from your application

So first you will build your JavaScript application and then create a docker image out of that JavaScript artifact.

Question: what happens to this Docker image once it gets created by the Jenkins build?
Answer: it gets pushed to a private docker repository.

> Note: A company may use a private docker repository as it does not want external people to be able to access to its docker images. This is why companies may choose to push the docker image to a private docker repository.

The next step could be configured on Jenkins' or some other scripts or tools. That Docker image has to be deployed on a development server that pulls the image from the private repository, the JAvaScript application and Mongo DB which the JavaScript application depends on from Docker Hub.

Now, you will have two containers, one, your custom container and a publicly available Mongo DB container running on dev server. They talk and communicate to each other after configuration and run as an aplication.

This means, if a tester now logs into the dev server, they will be able to test the application. 

This was an example of how Docker will work in a real-life process of making an application.

# Developing with Containers - TO BE COMPLETED

Here, we will look at how to use docker in a local development process. 

Demo of a JavaScript and node JS application to simulate a local development process and then will connect it to a docker container with a Mongo DB in it.

Here, we will look at how to work with docker containers when developing applications.

First step will be is we going to develop a very simple UI backend application using JavaScript, very simple HTML structure and node JS in the backend. 

And in order to integrate all of this in the database, we are going to use a docker container of a MongoDB database and will allow working with the MongoDB much easier so we don't have to execute commands in the terminal.

We will deploy a Docker container of a Monga UI, which is called the Mongar Express, where we can see the database structure and all the updates that our application is making in the database.

**So, this development setup should give you an idea of how docker containers are actually used in the development process.**

Here, is some very simple JavaScript application. we have this index HTML with Javascript and using Node JS backend which serves the Index HTML file....

and listens on port 3000. SO, the server is running at the backend and the UI is at the frontend.

So, if we make changes to the profile, such as:

![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/107522496/203028771-388809e2-b1ac-4dbe-abc4-76ec52dccb1d.png)

the issue is that when we refresh the page, the changes are lost as there's no persistent component in this application.

To be able to save changes, we need to integrate the application with a database. This is how real-life applications work. 

Will demo how you can actually use the docker containers to make the development process easier by just pulling one of the databases and connecting it to the application.

So, for this demo, we will go with a MongoDB application and in addition to this MongoDB container, will also deploy a MongoDb UI, which will be in its own container, which is called Mongo Express where we can manage or see the database insights and updates from our application much easier.

Go to Docker Hub and find the MongoDB Image.

First pull the MongoDB official image. doesnâ€™t take as long here as it MongoDB Latest is already installed on this machine

> Mongo Express is what we will use for the UI.

Then pull the Mongo Express.

As it is also already installed on this machine, won't take as long.

Now if we check locally, we can see we now have them installed.
